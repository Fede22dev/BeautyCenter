"""
App version following Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

Format (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
 - MAJOR: increment when you make incompatible changes that break backward compatibility (e.g., API changes or removals, breaking features).
 - MINOR: increment when you add new backward-compatible functionality (e.g., new features without breaking existing ones).
 - PATCH: increment for bug fixes, security patches, or minor improvements without changing functionality or APIs.

Pre-release tags can be used before 1.0.0 or before stable releases:
 - alpha: early development, unstable, incomplete features
 - beta: feature-complete but needs testing
 - rc (release candidate): potentially final unless major bugs are found

Example:
 0.9.0-alpha = early preview version
 0.9.0-beta = almost ready, needs real-world testing
 1.0.0-rc1 = final testing before stable release
 1.0.0 = first stable release
 1.1.0 = new feature added without breaking changes
 1.1.1 = bug fix on version 1.1.0
 2.0.0 = breaking change, major rewrite
