## ✨ What is BeautyCenter?

**BeautyCenter** is a sleek and modular desktop application built in **Python** with **Qt (PySide6)**.  
It helps beauty and wellness centers manage:

- 🧍‍♀️ Clients

- 💆‍♀️ Treatments
- ⚙️ Settings and business logic

> 🧠 Designed for maintainability, offline-first usage, and cloud sync in future releases.

- Each page is split into:
    - `.ui` file (view/layout)
    - `.py` file (logic/controller)
